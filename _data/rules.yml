  items: >
      Individuals must be 21 years of age or older to qualify. 
      Any individual who qualifies as a “Prohibited Person” under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) shall be deemed ineligible to 
      receive the promotion. Individuals will be notified and will be required to sign and return an Affidavit of 
      Eligibility and an accompanying document noting such individuals release of liability/publicity. Such documents 
      shall be delivered to Sigwo Arms, LLC located at 522 W. Commercial St, Springfield, MO 65803, within 15 days of 
      notification of promotion eligibility. If an individual fails to return the affidavit and release within the 
      15-day period, the gift will be forfeited. Acceptance of the gift, in the form of the signing of the Affidavit of 
      Eligibility and the accompanying release shall give Sigwo Arms, LLC and partnering companies permission to use such 
      individuals name in any marketing, promotional materials, or government documents needed to effectuate the 
      transfer of the promotional item(s). Should an individual fail to qualify for the promotion, any item subject 
      to the promotion will be substituted to such individual in the form of a gift card to Amazon.com Inc., d/b/a/ 
      Amazon in an equal amount to the promotion’s value. Such gift card shall be issued by Sigwo Arms, LLC. Promotion 
      is non-transferable to any individual other than the person who received such promotion. Following the delivery 
      of the Affidavit of Eligibility and the accompanying release, Sigwo Arms, LLC shall begin production of the 
      promotional item(s). Individuals will be notified when their gift is completed and ready to pick up, wherein 
      a background check (Form 4473) will be run and completed upon delivery of the promotional item(s), if necessary. 
      The phrase “promotional items” is not intended to serve as a legal definition but used only for clarity in 
      identifying the underlying promotion. Any individual redeeming such promotion shall be personally responsible 
      for any items deemed taxable by either the State of Missouri or the Internal Revenue Service.
